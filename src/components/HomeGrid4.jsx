Each of these is considered to add reassurance towards having peace in your mind-for an AKC paper with your French Bulldog Puppy is highly vital with the Dealer French bulldogs.

        <h1>AKC FRENCH BULLDOGS BREEDERS</h1>
        <p>
        Training your new pup starts here with one of the top AKC Frenchie Breeders. We start training our puppies to use puppy pads at age 4-5 weeks old. That means by the time they get to their new forever homes, they have already gotten used to going to the bathroom outside of the play area and nursing areas.
        </p>
        <p>
        By doing this, it sets your new pup up for housebreaking success. Believe it or not, this is a huge benefit for their forever owners. Our new puppy owners are constantly telling us how easy their pup was to house break, which is not a "common trait" for Frenchies.

        There is no such thing as a bargain basement Frenchie. Be very careful of "AKC Frenchie for sale websites" that allow breeders to list countless dogs with no information regarding parents/genetics/health. As sad as it sounds, these dogs are typically raised in cages from puppy mills and allowed to relieve themselves right in their own cage which typically has a wire bottom, and a tray underneath to catch feces.

        Because these pups are not set up for success and are a nightmare to housebreak if they ever are even housebroken! Finding good quality AKC Frenchie puppies is not easy, or cheap. Consider our pups "well started" on the way to potty training. As experienced breeders and whelper, we start pee pad training process at 5 weeks old.
