        <h1>FRENCHIES STUD NEAR ME</h1>
        <p>
          Don't just settle for any Frenchie stud near me. You can have the best
          if you live anywhere in the USA! Elon is a blue and tan Merle,
          carrying both fluffy L1 and testable chocolate, which means he will be
          able to produce Isabella, Lilac, Blue, and varieties of those same
          colors with the Merle Pattern, too. He produces stunning puppies,
          carrying his short back and short leg genes, large head, amazing
          muzzle and rope, and little to no tail.

          Elon has a great temperament: super docile and loving yet loves to
          play if you initiate. He fetches as well as he cuddles and snuggles
          and is an overall quiet dog, too. He does well with babies, cats, and
          other puppies in addition to larger adult Frenchies. Overall, his
          physical structure and appearance, his sought-after unique genetics,
          and his 1 in a million temperament make him one of the top studs, if
          not the top Frenchie Stud carrying both Fluffy and Isabella in the
          United States.
