          It was a pleasure dealing with Designer French Bulldog Frenchies. I
          recieved a health happy puppy. No problems at his vet visit. He is
          getting along with all my other dogs. He made the transfer so easy. My
          dog went from Florida to Kentucky with a dog nanny. This company is
          very professional. If I want another dog I will go right back to
          Designer French Bulldog Frenchies.

          We are thrilled with our new family member, Mac! Brian was so patient
          with us on deciding on our new baby and Designer French Bulldogs
          didn’t disappoint us at all. Everything was communicated well and the
          process was easy! Thank you so much for the care you put into your
          French Bulldogs!

        <p>Exquisite Frenchie Experience with Designer French Bulldogs</p>
        <p>
          I can’t recommend Designer French Bulldogs and Brian highly enough!
          From the moment I reached out about the Isabella Merle Frenchie, we
          had our eye on, the experience was nothing short of exceptional.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brian’s professionalism and dedication to his pups shined through
          every step of the process. Despite the distance between us and our pup
          (Florida to New Jersey), Brian made the entire experience seamless.
          His communication was prompt and informative, always keeping us in the
          loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The highlight, of course, was welcoming our new fur baby into our
          home. She arrived safe and sound, thanks to the impeccable care
          provided by the puppy nanny. Not only is she absolutely stunning, but
          her temperament is a testament to the love and care she received from
          Brian and his team.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re looking for a reputable breeder who prioritizes the health
          and well-being of their pups, breeds for health and structure, look no
          further than Brian and Designer French Bulldogs. Thank you, Brian, for
          bringing so much joy into our life with my precious Ivy!

          I received my beautiful and sweet male platinum Frenchie this past
          Thursday (flown into Savannah with the awesome Melissa, the pet
          traveling nanny), and we are absolutely in love! He is PERFECT! Thank
          you Brian and Jen for raising such a beautifully structured high
          quality pup whose disposition is as sweet as he looks and for the
          continued assistance over text messaging as I get this little guy
          adjusted to his new home. :)
