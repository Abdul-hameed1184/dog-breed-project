        <h2>Blue and Tan Merle French bulldog</h2>
        <p>
          The Blue and Tan Merle French Bulldog, or blue and tan merle Frenchie,
          is also amazing! Primarily, this is a dog that would have been blue
          and tan, many times with white chest. Because one of the parents is
          "merle,"this causes the blue and tan really to pop against the broken
          merle patterns. For example, our stud Elon is a blue and tan merle
          Frenchie; absolutely stunning!.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the tan points some will have two copies of intensity, so the
          tan points will appear more vibrant or "orange or red points". Others
          will have two copies of the "dilute" gene which will give them lighter
          tan points.
        </p>
        <h2>Blue Merle French Bulldog</h2>
        <p>
          Another ultra-popular option for those considering blues is the merle.
          A Blue Merle French Bulldog is stunning in its own right and has an
          amazing contrasting of the Merle over the blue pattern these pups are
          just breathtaking
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, the amount of merle on the puppy will state how much blue or
          merle they are overall; large patches of blue usually means high
          percentage of Merle. Blue eyes also will be more common in Merle dogs
          over standard blue, which typically will have brown eyes as an adult.
          The AKC is just recently starting to recognize colors that are
          considered 'newer', like blue and lilac, to date.
        </p>
        <h5>Blue Fluffy French Bulldog</h5>
        <p>
          Fluffy frenchies are just a super popular breed, all because of their
          soft, long-haired coat. Now, as a buyer, you even have the option of
          the Blue Fluffy French Bulldog! These are super-cute "fluffy" versions
          of the famous and in-demand Blue Frenchie. Furry, or fuzzy, these Long
          Haired Frenchies boast a long coat and more often appear to be little
          bear cubs than puppies upon their arrival. Ah-there's little cuter
          than a Fluffy Frenchie puppy in our humble opinions!

          These "hobby French Bulldog breeders" that have no business breeding
          at all and are producing sickly pups that do not look anything like
          they're supposed to. Hobby breeders take cheap dogs that had no
          business being bred and create low-quality pups, continuing the cycle.
          It is for this reason that Frenchies can be considered a breed with
          health issues.

        <h2>Blue French bulldog cost</h2>
        <p>
          Blue Frenchie pups are just beautiful- be they merle or non merle or
          Fluffy French Bulldog puppies. The years of breeding have paid off and
          the blue French bulldog cost is now not as high as those really rare
          colors. Blues in our opinion are amazing solid, with tan points or
          tricolor. The amount of blue on the Merle pups will vary on overall
          percentage of merle present.
        </p>
        <p>
          Merle Frenchie puppies can had lots of solid patches or be almost all
          speckled with color and merle pattern. This is because the higher the
          percentage merle gene, the larger the solid patches of color. These
          contain the lilac merle French bulldog, as well as the blue merle
          French bulldog. Other colors are either cheaper or more expensive
          based on how rare they are. For example, the Rojo merle French bulldog
          cost is going to be the most expensive of all merles as of this
          update.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you move along the scale, the rarer the base coat, the more money
          and harder to find the puppy. For example, an Isabella merle French
          bulldog price is near the top of the mark regarding the merle-based
          Frenchie price chart.
        </p>
        <h3>How much are blue French Bulldogs?</h3>
        <p>$6,000 to $9000</p>
        <p>
          On average, a blue French bulldog puppy for sale will range from
          $6,000 to $9,000 or more. The higher the price tag usually but not
          always comes from a breeder who invests more in the cost of the
          parents. This is usually done for both health reasons, as well as
          size, structure, and conformation to the French bulldog breed standard
          set by the AKC.
        </p>
        <h5>What is a rare-colored Frenchie?</h5>

        <p>
          The typical French Bulldog colors being cream, white, brindle, fawn,
          and mixtures of the last three. In this context, what can be stated to
          be considered as rare in this line of French Bulldogs color are
          actually solid black, blue lilac, platinum, and Isabella together with
          patterns like chocolate tan, mink merle, plush, and fluffy hair coats.
        </p>
        <h5>What is the most costly Bulldog color?</h5>

        <p>
          As of today, the Fluffy Rojo Merle colored French Bulldogs are
          probably the most expensive of the bunch at the time of this writing.
          Rojo Merle Fluffy French Bulldog puppies can sell for as much as
          $25,000!
        </p>
        <h2>What color French Bulldog is the healthiest?</h2>
        <p>
          Really, from a good breeder, they are all healthy dogs. As far as
          healthiness goes, French Bulldogs, like any other breed, are
          predisposed to certain genetic conditions. These can include
          respiratory issues, skin allergies, and joint problems. However, the
          color of their coat has no direct correlation with their health.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/program3.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          For that reason, be super careful who you buy from! There's a reason
          that, in 15+ years, we have never produced a puppy that had one single
          health issue to our knowledge. We have never had to replace a puppy,
          and no puppy that we produced here at Designer Frenchies has EVER
          required any type of"bulldog surgery"
        </p>
        <h2>How long do blue French Bulldogs live?</h2>

        <p>
          Fully grown, the average weight of a healthy French Bulldog is from
          16-27 pounds and stands about 10-12 inches tall at the shoulder. The
          normal life expectancy of a French Bulldog is between 11-14 years
          although life expectancy may be affected by several factors including
          genetics and diet.
        </p>
        <h2>Do Blue French Bulldogs Shed a lot?</h2>
        <p>
          That is something which depends on a breeder and genetics. Frenchies
          can carry 1, 2, or zero copies of the LPS gene, or as it is called-low
          propensity to shed gene. A dog with zero copies will shed a lot; a dog
          with one copy can shed moderately
        </p>
        <p>
          This puppy with 2 copies of this LPS gene, like all of our dogs, will
          not shed hardly at all. We have 5 Frenchies in our home and we do not
          have any dog fur anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the French Bulldog breed is a little bit of an outlier
          regarding shedding because there are quite a few different variables
          that can play into the amount and timing of when these short-haired
          dogs shed.
        </p>
        <h2>Are blue and tan French Bulldogs healthy?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, if purchased from the right breeder, these can be super healthy,
          easy-to-care-for dogs! Due to bad breeding, hobby breeders, puppy
          mills, Frenchies have gotten a bad rap for overall health. Therefore,
          there is definitely warranted speculation that blue Frenchies may have
          a higher likelihood of certain health problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although that is not correct, the uninformed will say that the genes
          responsible for the blue coat could potentially cause skin issues.
          Others will say it is related to allergies and color dilution
          alopecia, leading to the loss of fur or issues with the skin. On the
          whole, we are not seeing ANY of these in ANY of our lines here at
          Designer Frenchie puppies.
        </p>
        <h2>Are Blue French Bulldogs rare?</h2>
        <p>
          Not super rare, but they sure were years ago! Blue Frenchie for sale,
          blue tan and blue merle French bulldog are stunning in their rare
          colors. The blue hue is striking and the tan points add just the right
          contrast to make a tuxedo or full suit.
        </p>
        <h2>What DNA makes a blue Frenchie blue?</h2>
        <p>The D Locus is responsible for the blue color.</p>
        <p>
          Two alleles that matter are the dominant full color (D) and the
          recessive dilute (d). Two copies of dilute gene are therefore
          necessary to lighten black pigment to grey (now referred to as blue)
          and red pigment to cream. A DNA blood test usually done at a specific
          lab for canine color and health DNA.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/program3.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          We normally use Animal Genetics labs for all our Frenchie blood tests.
          Other popular labs include UC Davis. This test will identify the
          specific variants of the MLPH genes within the French bulldog puppies
          to show color and colors they "carry" or can "produce"if bred.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for top quality AKC Merle French Bulldog puppies,
          you have come to the right place! Each litter, we try our best to
          produce about 50% of this coat type. While not guaranteed, it is
          always at least 1-2 of the puppies that come out merle. Breeding for
          different colors of the Merle coat type is our specialty here at DFB.
          Our main studs, Elon, and Goober have produced some of the nicest
          offspring you can every imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we are looking for structure. Short, thick and compact dogs that
          exemplify our version of the best possible French Bulldog. These dogs
          have 9-11″ backs, 9-11″ legs but are thick and dense. Our males will
          have larger heads, perfect ropes over their noses, and a flat but not
          concave profile.
        </p>
        <h2>Healthy Bulldogs for sale</h2>
        <p>
          None of our puppies have ever required ANY Bulldog common surgery. By
          breeding for proper structure and health first and foremost our dogs
          are simply enjoyable from day one. Owning any bulldog that is not from
          good breed stock can be an expensive experience both physically and
          mentally.
