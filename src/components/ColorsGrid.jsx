          truly top-class Fluffy French Bulldog puppies for sale. Could they be
          the most adorable of all the Frenchies? That, of course, is
          subjective, but Fluffy Frenchies are undeniably charming and among the
          rarest in the Frenchie world. One of the newest and rarest varieties,
          Fluffy French Bulldogs are unique in their appearance and quite
          endearing. It's no surprise that searches for “Fluffy Frenchies for

        <h1>FLUFFY FRENCHIES PUPPIEIS</h1>
        <p>
          Better known as the furry Frenchie, these long-haired French Bulldogs
          certainly are one of a kind. But just how rare are they? Their unique
          coats are brought about by the long-haired L1 and L4 genes—both
          responsible for that soft, fluffy fur. Our puppies here at Southeast
          Elite Frenchies carry an additional gene, which is the LS for
          low-shedding properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The magic lies in the genes with a Fluffy Frenchie: both parents must
          carry at least one copy of the L4 gene. When that's the case, the
          puppies will either have the signature fluffy coat or inherit the gene
          themselves, passing on the potential for long fur in future
          generations.

        <p>
          At Southeast Elite Frenchies, our Fluffy French Bulldogs, better known
          as Fluffy Frenchies, are as rare as they can be cute. Long-haired
          Frenchies are quite different in their coats from the rest, and
          although it is difficult to tell at birth, within weeks, the fluff
          starts to show. Curiously enough, even Fluffy carriers develop a
          fuller, shinier coat than standard French Bulldogs at times.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have Fluffy Frenchies in amazing colors, including blue, Isabella,
          lilac, black, cocoa, Rojo, new shade Isabella, and new shade Rojo. The
          rarest-and most expensive-usually tend to be the new shade Rojo and
          new shade Isabella. Not all Fluffies are created equal! Our Fluffy
          Frenchies are bred for superior structure-think a well-built, compact,
          thick pup with that signature Frenchie charm.

        <h1>FLUFFY FRENCHIE PRICE</h1>
        <p>
          At Southeast Elite Frenchies, the price of a Fluffy French Bulldog
          varies based on color rarity and genetics. Fluffies come in a wide
          range of colors, from the more common shades to highly sought-after
          rare hues. Our breeding program focuses on producing some of the most
          stunning long-haired Frenchies you’ll ever see
        </p>
        <p>

          Bulldogs, including blue, black, blue tan, black tan, lilac, lilac
          tan, merle varieties, Isabella, and the very rare Rojo. Each color
          reflects the unique genetics of the Fluffy Frenchie, making them just
          as diverse as their short-haired counterparts.

          Frenchies is bred to be quality, structure, and beauty-so no matter
          the color, you will get an amazing pup.
        </p>
        <p>
          While all Fluffy Frenchies are absolutely stunning, the rarer the
          color, the higher the price it usually comes with. For example, a
          Lilac Tan Fluffy will cost more than a Brindle Fluffy, while an
          Isabella Fluffy will cost more than a Lilac Fluff. At Southeast Elite
          Frenchies, we understand that while finding the perfect pup is super
          exciting, it can also be peppered with questions. Thus, herein are
          answers to some of the most important and frequently asked questions
          about the long-haired version of the great French Bulldog
        </p>
        <img src="/images/colors4.jpg" alt="" />
        <h1>Does the AKC Recognize Fluffy French Bulldog Puppies?</h1>
        <p>
          While there is no specific checkbox for "Fluffy" on AKC registration
          forms, you can fully register your Fluffy Frenchie with the American
          Kennel Club. The AKC officially recognizes around 6-7 traditional
          French Bulldog colors, but rest assured-all of our puppies at
          Southeast Elite Frenchies are 100% AKC registered.
        </p>
        <p>
          We breed with the priority to the AKC standard for the best health,
          structure, and temperament but specialize in the most unique and
          rarest of colors on the Frenchie color chart to provide a
          one-of-a-kind registered companion.
        </p>
        <h3>How Much is a Fluffy Frenchie Worth?</h3>
        <p>
          The price of a Fluffy French Bulldog is strongly related to coat color
          and rarity. Traditional-colored Fluffy Frenchie puppies usually cost
          from $8,800 to $25,000 USD, whereas rare colors such as Isabella,
          Rojo, Lilac Tan, and Merle may be as high as $19,000 USD or even
          higher. Pups with pet-only AKC paperwork are much cheaper than those
          with full AKC registration
        </p>
        <h3>Are Fluffy Frenchies Rare?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, Fluffy French Bulldogs are rare due to the unusual **L1 and L4
          hair length genes** responsible for their characteristic long coat.
          This genetic trait is not common in regular French Bulldogs, and thus
          Fluffies are a special and highly desired variation. This is one more
          reason for their high price: **genetic rarity and high demand**.
        </p>
        <h3>Can Fluffy Frenchies be AKC Registered?</h3>
        <p>
          While the AKC breed standard still recognizes only short-haired
          Frenchies in traditional colors such as white, fawn, cream, and
          brindle, Fluffy Frenchies will be fully registered with the AKC, just
          not in a show ring competing in conformation shows, as it is not
          within the guidelines in the AKC breed standards. They will get to
          compete in the rest of the AKC events, be regarded as full pedigree,
          and registered.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/colors5.jpg" alt="" />
        <h3>Are Fluffy Frenchie High Maintenance</h3>
        <p>
          Generally french Bulldogs are pretty low-maintenancee dogs regarding
          grooming. In this instance, with a long coat, Fluffy Frenchies may
          require frequent brushing and baths against tangles and mats for
          healthy, clean fur. Just like all French Bulldogs, regular cleaning of
          facial wrinkles and ears is necessary to prevent infections. They also
          need special care in hot weather because Frenchies tend to be
          sensitive to overheating.
        </p>
        <h3>Do Fluffy French Bulldogs Shed Much?</h3>
        <p>
          French Bulldogs are generally low shedders, though this can vary with
          genetics. Much of this comes down to the LP gene, or Low Propulsion to
          Shed. A dog with two copies of the LP gene sheds very little. Most
          responsible breeders, such as Southeast Elite Frenchies, focus their
          breeding on Fluffies that carry two copies of this gene. In those
          without the LP gene or with only one copy, shedding may be heavier.
        </p>
        <h3>How Long Do Fluffy French Bulldogs Live?</h3>
        <p>
          The life expectancy of a Fluffy French Bulldog is the same as that of
          a standard French Bulldog: between 10 to 14 years. A healthy Frenchie
          weighs between 16-28 pounds and stands about 10 to 12 inches tall at
          the shoulder. The life expectancy can be determined by factors such as
          diet, exercise, genetics, and overall care.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/colors6.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          By choosing a high-quality breeder like Southeast Elite Frenchies,
          you’re ensuring a Fluffy Frenchie that is not only visually stunning
          but also bred for health, structure, and longevity
        </p>
        <p>
          Fluffy French Bulldogs Our French Bulldogs are fluffy and come in a
          variety of colors, some of which are very rare and hence more
          expensive. When talking about searching for a fluffy Frenchie, this
          usually means the long-haired French Bulldog.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, such puppies have two copies of the LS gene responsible for
          a reduction in shedding. Having five fluffy Frenchies at home, we can
          assure you that shedding is just minimal. They possess all the same
          features as the standard French Bulldog, but with soft, fluffy coats
          that set them apart. However, fluffy Frenchies tend to be more
          expensive than short-haired ones, regardless of color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably the most common search in regards to this breed is "fluffy
          Frenchie puppies near me." When looking upon a litter of fluffy
          Frenchie puppies, one easily falls in love. Visit our pups page and
