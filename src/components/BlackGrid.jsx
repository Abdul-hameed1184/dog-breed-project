          At one time the most popular but now probably the most common is the
          black French bulldog. As far as the Frenchie price chart, the black is
          on the more affordable end. Obviously, quality puppies come from more
          expensive parents. Due to this, there is a scale in cost regarding the
          cost of medical expenses that run around 10k per litter. In addition,
          you have the added cost of the Sire and Dam.

          Owning a black pup will be cheaper in cost compared to the more rare
          colors. The newer the color, typically the higher the price points.
          Some people just love black dogs, where as others do not. The great
          thing about it is you can find the perfect pup for your color pallet
          and budget! More common than colors like Isabella, blue, lilac, rojo
          and platinum the Black and tan frenchie pups are stunning in their own
          right and at one time were very sought after.

          which means "tan points" or black and tan. Their specific appearance
