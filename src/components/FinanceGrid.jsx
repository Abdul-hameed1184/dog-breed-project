          The newest and rarest, and some would say cutest, is the fluffy French
          bulldog."Fluffy Frenchies for sale" or Fluffy Frenchie puppies for
          sale are becoming common searches from soon-to-be puppy owners. The
          way the fluffy French Bulldog gene works is that both parents must
          carry a copy of the L4 gene. If both parents carry a minimum of one
          copy, then the puppies will either be visually fluffy or carriers of
          at least one copy of the gene for long fur
