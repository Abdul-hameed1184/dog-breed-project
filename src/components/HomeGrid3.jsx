        <h2>Is that a Boston Terrier or a Frenchie?t</h2>
        <p>
        The SouthEast Elite Frenchies Bulldog puppies are very nice in conformation for structure and size. There is such variation these days in the quality and structure, which in other words means that the dog in itself can look many different ways.

        <h2>Be careful out there!</h2>
        <p>
        If you are looking only for high-quality AKC breeders locally, you are going to limit yourself to quite a number of high-quality programs. Because virtually any higher level AKC Frenchie Breeder can send their pups with nannies direct to you. The web is filled to the brim with not just hobby breeders cranking out less-than-healthy dogs that are tough to look at. Beyond health and overall structure, high level vs low quality dogs, risk comes from scammers.

        <h2>Fake French Bulldog Breeders</h2>
        <p>
        Nigerian scammers have basically made it very difficult for hobby breeders overall by stealing pictures from breeder websites and listing fake dogs. If you see a FBD listed for 2000-3000-4000, it is most likely fake. If it is not fake, it certainly is lower quality. Although this risk exists, you can mitigate it by buying from a real experienced breeder like us!
