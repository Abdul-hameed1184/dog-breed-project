        <p>
          Working with Top AKC French Bulldog Genetics, French Bulldog Breeders
          were able to create a beautiful color contrasting Blue and Violet to
          form what we now call the Lilac Frenchie
        </p>
        <p>
          Lilac French Bulldog for sale are often mistaken for blue Frenchies
          however they are not the same. The color lilac is definitely harder to
          find and considered more rare than blues.
        </p>
        <p>
          With their striking silver-ish to blue hue, lilac French Bulldogs are
          easy to spot as they "pop" when you see them. Overall, Lilac is
          considered and highly sought after for many Frenchie owners.
        </p>
        <h1>Lilac French Bulldog Puppies</h1>
        <p>
          In addition to their light blue silver with light blue to light grey
          eyes, the personalities of the Lilac French Bulldogs are very friendly
          and affectionate.
        </p>
        <p>
          These puppies really enjoy spending time with their owners-playing or
          just chilling. One thing to bear in mind: the lilac French Bulldog
          price is a tad higher compared to common Frenchie varieties due to
          this color being one of the rare types, while Fawn, Pied, Black,
          Brindle, among others are rather common colors.
        </p>
        <p>

          available Frenchie puppies section. If you do not see the puppy that

          we are just about to list that can be reserved.

          shoot us an email, call or text, and see what's available. There isn't

        <h3>Whatis a Lilac French Bulldog?</h3>
        <p>
          The Lilac French Bulldog color is an exceptionally unique and
          beautiful variety of the breed. Lilac Frenchie puppies are often
          confused with the blue variety, but notwithstanding, they have an
          extra light silver color.
        </p>
        <p>
          More often than not, this color gets lighter and lighter as the puppy
          matures into a full grown dog. For breeders to work with the right
          genetics in order to produce the lilac color the mother and father
          must be the right colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          For lilac, for example, the parents need to be blue and chocolate or
          at least a chocolate carrier; this is not to be confused with
          "testable chocolate" responsible for Isabella and other variations. If
          you are a fan of blue eyes, you might want a Lilac puppy! Lilac
          Frenchies generally have lighter-colored eyes in color, which may be
          ice blue, light blue grey, or sometimes just blue.
        </p>
        <h3>Lilac Frenchies for sale</h3>
        <p>
          Up until about ten years ago, Lilac Frenchie for sale was the figment
          of imagination. After years of careful breeding, Lilac French bulldog
          breeder groups were able to create a beautiful pigment that almost
          glows light purple - or lilac, as such - and named it accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes people will refer to lilac as blue, but lilac is normally
          going to be lighter and react much differently to light itself. A
          lilac Frenchy for sale is going to look a great deal lighter compared
          to a blue French Bulldog puppy
        </p>
        <img src="images/available8.jpg" alt="" />

        <p>
          It's now possible to find a Lilac puppy with reasonable prices for
          quality pups. The lilac merle Frenchie or lilac and tan merle is
          another stunning color combination. Lilac Merle French bulldog puppies
          look very similar to the blue merle french bulldog when first born but
          the blue will end up darker than the Lilac.
        </p>
        <h3>AKC lilac Frenchie puppies</h3>
        <p>
          If you've already decided to bring the Lilac Frenchie puppy into your
          home, the next important decision is the color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing from a wide array of colors that include unique color
          combinations can be tough. Even without including the more expensive
          rare Frenchie colors, you will find yourself going in circles as to
          which is your favorite French bulldog puppies of all.
        </p>
        <h3>Lilac French Bulldog price</h3>
        <p>
          Lilac is a medium priced color so it is not as high as the rarer color
          combinations like Isabella, Rojo, to name a couple. Keep in mind you
          can also find a rare version of this color, the "fluffy lilac
          Frenchie". This as you would expect is the furry, or long-haired
          version of the lilac

        <h4>Lilac French bulldog puppies</h4>
        <p>
          It's not always easy to find the right Lilac bulldog puppies. The task
          of finding "any" lilac frenchie differs from finding the right one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, most of the Frenchie pups are cute as can be, but there is a
          significant difference among Frenchie breeders, as there is so much
          variation in this small breed that varies based on the quality of the
          parents and grandparents who are the foundation of the breeding
          program
        </p>
        <h3>Other color varieties of Lilac Frenchies </h3>
        <p>
          Aside from the blue variety, there is another stunning and attractive
          color belonging to the Merle family: the Lilac Merle French bulldog.
          While all solid lilac frenchie puppies and blue french bulldog puppies
          are stunning, the broken pattern makes them distinctive. Even
          better-looking, if one might say, are the tan-pointed merle versions!
          Lilac Merle Frenchie puppies are out of this world, and no two ever
          look alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is actually a question of personal preference when you decide
          between blues and lilacs or the merle version of those colors. Here at

          other variation under the sun

          All the above have fluffy variations, too! Note that fluffy frenchie
          puppies will be higher in price than their counterpart, the
          non-fluffy. For example, lilac french bulldog puppies that are fluffy
          in coat would go for higher as compared to the non-fluffy variety by
          about 30%. Other varieties of these are Lilac Fluffy Frenchy, or even
          a fluffy lilac Merle puppy
