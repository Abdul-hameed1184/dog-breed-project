        <h2>FLUFFY FRENCH BULLDOG PUPPIES</h2>
        <p>
          Like all other Frenchies, fluffy Frenchies for sale come in different
          colors including all of the common and rare French Bulldog colors.
          French bulldog genetics are fun to work with and we are able to create
          some of the most amazing fluffy frenchie colors you will ever see.
          While they are all gorgeous, the rarer colors of fluffy frenchies will
          cost more than the more common. For example, a Lilac tan Fluffy will
          cost more than a brindle fluffy. At the same time, a Isabella Fluffy
          will cost more than a Lilac Fluff.

        <p>
          French bulldog babies are available throughout the year and ready to
          go home at 8 weeks or older. From time to time we will hold back a dog
          and offer them slightly older to decide if they should be part of our
          program or we already have a dog with the same genetics etc.
          Understanding the different colors and how they effect availbility,
          rarity and pricing is important when deciding which type of frenchie
          is right for you.

        <h1>MERLE FRENCH BULLDOG FOR SALE</h1>

        <p>
          The merle French bulldog can come in many colors and coat types. Most
          popular are the blue Merle french bulldog, as well as the lilac merle
          frenchie. Blue merles will be different in look than the solid blue
          French bulldog. Both are close in color and look with the Lilac being
          lighter in color. Merle French bulldog puppies are adorable and super
          unique as no two are every alike!
        </p>

          has at least 1 or 2 Merle French bulldog puppies for sale. Pricing
          will depend on which color you choose and if they are fluffy, a fluffy
          carrier or no fluffy. Lastly, the merle french bulldog price will
          depend on that above information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want unique than consider the merle french bulldog puppies that
          are amazing in our available pup section! Another popular color that
          has merle is the Lilac Merle French Bulldog also known as the Lilac
          Merle Frenchie. These are basically lilac Frenchie pups that have the
          merle gene which gives them a broken pattern which is breathtaking and
          unique! Lilac Frenchie puppies are still considered rare, where as
          blue are now more common amongst Frenchie breeders.

        <h1>ISABELLA FRENCHIES FOR SALE</h1>
        <p>
          If you want rare, than the Isabella French Bulldog is right for you.
          There are two shades including the normal Isabella french bulldog
          puppies and the New shade isabella Frenchie. Our Bella is a new shade
          with tan points and is absolutely stunning. She comes from dezigner
          bullz lines from the UK. Isabella french bullies carry one copy of the
          Cocoa gene which is also necessary for producing the Chocolate French
          Bulldog puppies.
        </p>
        <h4>Black and tan Frenchie puppies</h4>
        <p>
          At one time the most popular but now probably the most common is the
          black and tan French bulldog. Black and tan frenchie pups are stunning
          in their own right and at one time were very sought after. Now among
          the most common they are in the medium to low price range, unless they
          carry other colors and are visual or a carrier of the fluffy gene. All
          of this is only important to the buyer if they are a Frenchie breeder
          of course! Finding black and tan french bulldog puppies is not
          difficult but finding quality always is. There are a dime a dozen
          puppy mill websites selling low quality pups year round. Basically
          these are Black Frenchie pups that have tan points, and sometimes also
          white chests, thereby known as Tri-colors.
