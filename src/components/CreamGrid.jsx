        <h1>CREAM FRENCH ULLDOG</h1>
        <p>
          The Cream French Bulldog puppy is just beautiful. Similar to platinum
          but a little "off white in color" these are just super cute.
          Especially if you get a good one with proper rope over the nose and
          perfectly set ears. A Flat Face that is not depressed but still flat
          is what you should be looking for along with a short, stocky puppy.
          Cream Frenchies for sale fall in the middle of the road spectrum
          regarding the cream Frenchie price point.

        <h2>Are Cream French Bulldogs rare?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, cream, and also Platinum are considered fairly rare. In order to
          produce cream French bulldog puppies, both parents must carry one copy
          of the Cream color gene. An Estimated less than 10% of all Frenchie
          puppies born in the USA are cream or platinum in color. For this
          reason they are referred to as one of the rare Frenchie colors. For
          more information on French bulldog colors, or French bulldog genetics

          The Cream French bulldog cost is going to be along the same lines as
          the lilac and just above that of the blues. Maintaining a clean face
          can be a challenge with this color, and some are more work that
          others. Depending on how messy your puppy is, you may like or not like
          the maintenance this color may require. The thing is, baby wipes will
          get used way more on dogs of this color along with platinum, than just
          about any other color, in particular with dark ones.
        </p>
        <h2>Cream Frenchie Price</h2>
        <p>
          As mentioned the Cream Frenchie price will fall right in the middle as
          far as its rarity goes. Consider similar pricing as for blues and
          lilacs, less than an Isabella. These are really pretty dogs, and some
          of them will keep their beautiful blue eyes. Typically, the whiter the
          dog, the bluer the eyes is a rule of thumb. Customers just love this
          color, and there are few dogs as cute as a white or cream-colored
          Frenchie!
        </p>

          Cream Frenchies for sale are rare and beautiful. In some instances,
          cream color overrides other colors such as lilac or blue or chocolate.
          In such cases, then we would refer to the pup as a "lilac covered in
          cream, or platinum" or "blue covered in cream".
        </p>

          This means cream over rides other colors. Cream French bulldog puppies
          are not so common and usually run around 7500-9000 as a pet and bit
          more for full rights. Sometimes platinum frenchie pups are confused
          with creams because they are almost the same dog. The Frenchie puppy
          for sale that is platinum is still described as whatever the color
          would've been if mom and dad didn't carry cream, and then the world
          platinum.

        <h2>Cream Frenchie puppies near me</h2>
        <p>
          For example, it would've been a Lilac Frenchie instead would be Lilac
          Platinum French Bulldog. The same with the blue, and blue platinum,
          Isabella French bulldog turns to the Isabella platinum. Further than
          that you could have that to happen with tan points as well so Lilac in
          tan platinum appearing all white. This does not happen if the dog is a
          merle french bulldog puppy. A platinum or Cream French bulldog puppy
          price will fall somewhere in the vicinity of the lilacs and merles as
          well
