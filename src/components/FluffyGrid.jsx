        <h3>Fluffy French Bulldog</h3>
        <p>
          The newest and rarest and some say the cutest is the fluffy french
          bulldog. "Fluffy Frenchies for sale" or Fluffy Frenchie puppies for
          sale are becoming common searches from soon to be puppy owners. The
          way the fluffy gene works is that both parents must carry a copy of
          the L4 gene.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an L1 Gene as well, and both will produce the long hair
          version of this awesome little dog! We find it that the L1 does have
          longer fur throughout, whereas the L4 has the longest ear fur but not
          near as long throughout. With this reason, we are mostly working with
          L1's for the long-haired Frenchies for sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          If each parent carries at least one copy, then the puppies will either
          be visually fluffy or carry at least one copy of the gene for long
          fur. Considered rare and beautiful these have been a focus of our
          breeding program for a few years. Here at DFBD we have 3 fluffy
          females within our breed stock. Also, some of our other females are
          carrying the long-hair gene.

          Where and when did this type of Dog originate or become popular?
          Frenchie Breeders had isolated the long-haired French bulldog gene
          sometime in the 60s; however, at that time, they bred away from it.
          During the late 2018-2019 time, breeders within the United States and
          the United Kingdom began to work with these furry french bulldog and
          began producing fluffy puppies. A wide variety of colors exist with
          long hair. For example, there is a blue Fluffy Frenchie, also an
          Isabella, a Lilac, Merle versions, and more!
        </p>
        <h3>Fluffy Merle French Bulldog</h3>

          color variations, these furry little merle pups are just gorgeous!
          Like any other merle, no two are alike! Find them as blue fluffy

        </p>
        <h3>Fluffy French Bulldog Price</h3>
        <p>
          Did you know that when they were brand new, the fluffy french bulldog
          price exceeded $100,000! Relax! Nowadays fluffies range from 8500 and
          up and go up depending on how rare the color, or color combination is.
          For example, a more common color that has longer fur will be cheaper
          than something super rare, like a Rojo or new shade Isabella fluffy
          Frenchie.
        </p>
        <h3>Are fluffy French bulldogs rare?</h3>
        <p>
          They are considered to be, in comparison to a normal coat length dog.
          This is because of the very rare fluffy coat they carry. The L1 and L4
          hair length genes have this genetic "hair length allele" that is very
          seldom found within the French bulldog breed. Such is the case because
          the gene responsible for this is quite rare, and demand for Fluffy
          Frenchies is so high, putting a premium price on these compared to
          their non-fluffy version. How long do fluffy French bulldogs live?
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall the Fluffy Frenchie has the same lifespan as the normal non
          long haired Frenchie. Keep in mind that the average will be based on a
          healthy, normal sized Frenchie. For the most part the considered
          healthy weight for a French Bulldog is 16-28 pounds.
        </p>
        <h5>How much is a fluffy French bulldog worth?</h5>
        <p>
          Rare coat colors include Lilac, Blue, and Isabella, which can also
          raise the cost of a Fluffy French bulldog. Traditional-colored fluffy
          French bulldog puppies for sale usually cost about $8800 USD to
          $25,000 USD. That is the low end of the price point for fluffy
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, puppies with the more rare colors such as Isabella,
          Rojo, and lilac tan as well as merle can cost up to 19,000 USD. Pups
          with pet AKC paperwork will be cheaper than pups with full AKC
          registration.
        </p>
        <h3>Does a fluffy French French bulldog shed a lot?</h3>
        <p>
          Overall, the French bulldogs are viewed as low shedding and
          short-haired dogs. There is a gene referred to as the LP Gene, usually
          referred to as the low propensity to shed gene. Most high-level
          breeders like us only breed dogs that carriers of 2 copies of this
          gene. If so, your Fluffy Frenchie puppy should not shed a hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are, however, several different bloodlines of Frenchies, and
          some can shed worse than others. These dogs have no copies or only 1
          copy of the low propensity to shed gene. Fluffy Frenchies often have 1
          copy or none and therefore may shed. White this is normally true, they
          very well could have to copies of the LP gene and two copies of the L1
          or L4 gene and therefore could have long haired AND not shed. Is a
          fluffy French bulldog high maintenance?
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, Frenchies available for sale do not shed much or
          require extreme grooming. However, but a few of them that are more
          wrinkled will have to be cleaned now and then. This is simply to keep
          their ears and folds clean because they have the tendency to acquire
          skin infections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particular care should always also be addressed with regard to heat
          and exercise especially on very warm summer months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long haired or Fluffy Frenchie puppies will, of course need to be
          bathed and brushed a little more often. Still, considered they are a
          fluffy version of the standard French bulldog, they are reasonably
          easy to maintain.
        </p>
        <h3>How long to Fluffy French bulldogs live?</h3>
        <p>
          If you get a good one, Frenchies should be long lived and easy to care
          for! Normal height is 10 to 12 inches tall at the shoulder and better
          breeders breed for more compact, short dogs. The average French
          Bulldog lifespan is 10-14 years. At the same time, like people their
          life expectancy can be affected by many variables like diet,
          nutrition, exercise and genetics. The AKC lists them as 10-12 year
          lifespan dogs.
        </p>
        <h3>Can a fluffy Frenchie still be AKC registered?</h3>
        <p>
          Since the Fluffy French Bulldog variety is an extension of their
          smooth-coated siblings, AKC breed standard is simply short hair,
          standard color of white, fawn, cream, brindle, or combinations of any
          of those two colors. Other colors like Merle, pied, and other colors,
          they are still not breed standard. With that said, the long-haired
          French Bulldogs are able to be registered with the AKC, though they
          can't be shown.
