        <h2>FRENCH BULLDOG PUPPIES FOR SALE</h2>
        <p>
          A Brindle Frenchie is one of the staple colors of the breed itself.
          Interestingly, most high level breeders swear that it is super
          important to carry the brindle color gene. Why? Because they believe
          that dogs that possess the brindle allele whether expressed visually
          or not, have better structure. We see the same thing with the pied
          coloration. A French Bulldog Breeder actually will prefer that the dog
          carries both pied and / or brindle for structure purposes.
