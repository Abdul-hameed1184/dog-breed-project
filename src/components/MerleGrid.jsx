          Yet another variant of the Merle gene is the Lilac Merle Frenchie. As
          cool as the blue but even lighter in color the Lilacs are just
          breathtaking. Most blue and Lilac Merle keep their blue eyes that they
          are born with throughout their lives. Usually darked pigmented dogs
          will retain a darker shade of blue iris.

          From Merle to Chocolate to other variations, all in their price. The
          color of the base coat costs just as much as the Merle French bulldog,
          coupled with the fact of whether its a fluffy Frenchie for sale or
          not. Other great color that is simply stunning and breath-taking is an
          Isabella Merle Frenchie. Non-Fluffy and Fluffy. Isabella Frenchie can
          cost quite a bit as well due to how rare they are

        <h3>Finding the Right Frenchie Breeder for you</h3>
        <p>
          It's not a particularly fast process, finding the perfect French
          Bulldog puppy for sale, but it's not a difficult one, so long as you
          do your research and find the best possible breeder for your
          situation. That is to say, a breeder whose ideals are aligned with
          what you're looking for in your next family member. Do they breed for
          health? For temperament? Do they housebreak their puppies with pee
          pads to make things easier on you? Are their pups raised together
          learning normal behaviors or isolated in individual cages?
