        <h2>Whatis an Isabella French Bulldog?</h2>
        <p>
          The Isabella French Bulldog is one of the rarest and most sought-after
          color varieties of the breed. Beautifully unique in color, Isabella is
          a result of a dilute gene affecting melanin production. Melanin is
          responsible for the pigment eyes, fur, and skin. Overall, to describe
          the color, Isabella French Bulldogs have a fawn-colored coat, but much
          lighter and almost tinted blue. The very particular color variation of
          Frenchie, hard to describe and stunning to see, the Isabella color
          breed itself comes in variations now and is called new shade Isabella.
        </p>

          Why buy an Isabella French Bulldog puppy? Here at Designer Frenchies,
          our program is entirely focused on structure, health, and temperament

        </p>
        <p>
          You never will forget the first time you see an Isabella before you're
          familiar with this color. In the right light, it is literally
          jaw-dropping, for some. More often than not, our Isabella Frenchies
          are presold by reservation, and we always recommend a deposit ahead of
          time.

        <h3>Are Isabella French Bulldogs Rare?</h3>
        <p>
          Like rare colors? Obviously, they're great in looks, but come with
          their costlier tag than classic French Bulldog colors, naturally. The
          Isabella is light in color but just really cool-looking during the
          daylight hours--truly one of a kind. Years back, a "blue frenchie
          puppy" was considered extremely rare and could sell in excess of over
          $12,000.00 where today they are common with reasonable prices
          attached.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do they call itIsabella,then?</h3>
        <img src="images/available8.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Describing the color as a new, unique version, say, of the "fawn
          Frenchie", the name Isabella was chosen because it sounds "fancy", to
          put it in easy terms. Basically, it is a new and very beautiful
          version of the Fawn color if you wanted to pick a color that it was
          close to.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the AKC Recognize the Isabella French Bulldog color?</h3>
        <p>
          While you can fully register your new Isabella Frenchie puppy with the
          AKC, you will not find an "isabella" color box to check. The closest
          color you will have in proximity to checking is going to be close to
          fawn.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Difference when comparing an Isabella to the Lilac French Bulldog
        </h3>
        <p>
          These have gained color names of "lilac" and "Isabella" on these dogs.
          The name or "shade" has been assigned to these dogs describing the
          colors of their coat. We are comparing these two colors since they
          describe specifically the dilute colors shades and they carry two
          copies of "dilute" genes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically a lilac French Bulldog has a coat that is a diluted
          chocolate or brown color gene. This results in a silver to gray hue.
          You could almost call this color "champagne." Basically it is just the
          lilac color being created by the recessive color gene responsible for
          dilution of color or melanin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Description: When describing or comparing an Isabella Frenchie, the
          color of the Isabella will be a dilute variety of the popular super
          common fawn color. That gives it the look of a blue to grey color.
          Similar to the Lilac, a French bulldog with the Isabella color is also
          the result of a recessive dilution gene that affects melanin (color)
          production. More often than not, it is described as a color of tan,
          light brownish, or fawn color, with the addition of a combination with
          silver to blue hue again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, though both of them - Isabella and Lilac French bulldog
          puppies are results of the dilution genes that affected the colors of
          their coats, yet they produce quite different variations in color. It
          is critical to note that, since both the lilac and Isabella genes are
          so rare, so too are these two shades of Frenchie. Both Isabella and
          Lilac depend on combinations of recessive dilution genes, and both
          colors are considered a rare and sought-after color variety of
          Frenchie. For these reasons, the Isabella French bulldog price as well
          as the Lilac Frenchie price will be higher than common colors.

        <h3>Isabella Frenchie</h3>
        <p>
          With a real animal biologist on site, (our owner!) we work with some
          of the world's top French Bulldog Genetics. One of the coolest and
          rarest of all Frenchie colors, the Isabella Frenchie is just stunning.
          Other colors include the Isabella Merle and the New Shade Isabella as
          well, which is lighter than this color. When you are considering a new
          puppy it is always important to decide what your budget is because
          that will dictate what colors you are choosing from.
        </p>
        <h3>Isabella French Bulldog price</h3>
        <p>
          Typically, the Isabella French bulldog price is on the higher side
          because it is newer and rarer in color. In addition, so are the New
          Shade versions and the Rojo or red Chocolate versions. Our pups are
          going to be built different than most all other breeders. Focusing on
          short backs, short legs, muscle, and bone density is key
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not just looking at the size of the dog, but shape and weight
          over all mean a lot more to us. The high-density skeletal weight of a
          puppy is what's most important to us over size because we're looking
          for small, compact dogs with thick, dense bone and muscle. If you take
          a few moments to look at the photographs of our adults and puppies and
          compare to other dogs of this color, you will see what we think is a
          stark difference.
        </p>
        <h5>Short, thick and compact AKC Frenchies</h5>
        <p>
          Cuter, thicker, more compact is what you will find in a Designer
          Frenchie puppy versus most of what is out there. Hobby breeders have
          really saturated the French market with low-end dogs that should never
          have been produced. Look to the ears, the eyes, the rope over the
          nose, the profile, length of back and legs and there is no comparison.
          Couple this with outstandingly healthy and capable dogs and you have
          what we have worked over 15 years to develop. Taking pride in our
          breeding program is an understatement.
        </p>
        <h3>Breed with Pride</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most if not the most enjoyable things in working with these
          beautiful dogs is the smile we see on our clients' faces. We have
          customers that keep in touch with us from years and years ago with new
          pictures and stories about their once puppies now adult dogs.
        </p>
        <h3>Isabella French Bulldog for Sale</h3>
        <p>
          Quality AKC Isabellas are some of the coolest looking pups you’ll see.
          Almost a pewter with a lavender tint may be the best way to verbally
          describe this visually stunning color. Selective breeding by some of
          the best Frenchie Breeders in the USA were able to develop “Isabella”.
          Even dogs carrying the "testable chocolate gene" are considered rare
          as they are able to produce puppies with this color and its
          variations.
        </p>
        <p>
          When breeding two dogs that are visually the same color will make it
          so most pups are the same. Breeding two dogs that may "carry" the
          genes for a certain color make the offspring in that color possible,
          but not likely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Newer than this color would be what we call "new shade". New Shade
          Isabella: Lighter version of the color Isabella. The words "new shade"
          in the Frenchie Breeder world mean "lighter version of" so to speak.
