        <h1>ABOUT OUR FRENCH BULLDOG BREEDING PROGRAM</h1>
        <p>
          Designer French Bulldogs is a family run French Bulldog Breeder
          working with top bloodlines. Our Frenchies are "thick boned, and
          English Bulldog Esque"in cuteness, wrinkles and structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          We look for short, thick legs, short backs, little to no tail. In
          addition our pups have flat faces, even ropes over their noses and
          lots of wrinkles.
        </p>
        <p>
          As owner is an animal biologist from Richard Stockton University, thus
          has understood the genetics behind this wonderful breed on an entirely
          different level than most
        </p>
        <p>
          First, when trying to find the best Frenchie breeder, consider what a
          program is focused on. Those breeders that are not working to "better
          the breed" really should not be breeding in the first place! With each
          and every litter, we are looking to refine and improve our AKC French
          bulldog bloodlines.
        </p>
        <h4>Breeding for the perfect French Bulldog </h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, we value structure and health above everything
          else. A pup from Designer French Bulldogs have the short back and
          short leg genes. Most of our pups are at least fluffy carriers so they
          have nicer coats than non carriers. Looking for large heads, good bone
          and structure but small and compact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why are our puppies different? As noted above, we breed for shorter
          bodies and legs, not long legged giraffes. We are proud that all of
          our Frenchie puppies for sale are raised in our homes with our
          children, under foot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every single French Bulldog puppy are well socialized and you can
          expect a playful, smart, inquisitive and loving professional Snuggle
          Bug.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our puppies are started with pee pad training as early as 6 weeks,
          making them one of the easiest puppies you will ever house break!

        <h5>What makes Designer Frenchies differentthan the rest?</h5>
        <p>
          French bulldog breeders are a dime a dozen nowadays and with that
          comes a lot of low quality breedings. Since Frenchies are fairly
          small, compact dogs, hobby breeders who invest little to no money in
          quality bloodlines recently have flooded the Frenchie market.
          Unfortunately, you get what you pay for with this breed of dog.
        </p>
        <h3>Common French bulldog health issues</h3>
        <p>
          Frenchies are prone to many "bulldog type health issues"including
          cherry eye, hip issues, breathing issues, nostrils that are
          undersized, elongated soft pallet issues and more. When you purchase
          from us, you are also buying peace of mind.
