        <h3>Finding the perfect French bulldog puppies</h3>
        <p>
           If you see a pup available for under 4-5k, don't walk-run. Chances are you are going to spend triple that on vet bills and probably will not have the same experience as if you had owned a healthy French Bulldog puppy. Servicing the entire US, as French Bulldog breeders, we will be able to send your pup with a nanny direct to your airport.
        </p>
        <h3>What are Frenchie prices like?</h3>
        <p>
            Explaining where pricing comes from is quite simple. You take the price of mom, the price of dad and add them together. Divide that by the # of litters and the # of Frenchie puppies for sale. Now add around 10,000 in veterinary expenses. That is your price before you value your time at even $10.00 a hour. So, when you find crazy cheap pricing, there is always a reason. Usually, they paid nothing for mom and dad-more often than not the case.
        </p>
        <h3>The very real difference in structure and sizeâ€¦</h3>
        <p>
             More often than not, they breed tall, long dogs that do not require C-sections or Artificial Insemination. These dogs do not look like or are not shaped like top-quality dogs. One quick trip to the vet for a common bulldog health issue will cost you $5K in a blink; thus, remember, cheap is expensive with pure-bred French Bulldogs.

        <h3>best French Bulldog breeders</h3>
        <p>
            You will not find any quality AKC Frenchies for sale by price hunting. With this breed, you probably have more variation than in any other breed of purebred dog. Often, I come across hobby Frenchie breeders around me with no idea of what they are doing who breed dogs that have serious health issues.
        </p>
        <h3>Beware of hobby breeders</h3>
        <p>
           Not only will a cheap, hobby-bred AKC Frenchie puppy for sale not look the same, do not expect it to stay in good health, either. One simple "cherry eye" surgery and you are out 2-4k. All of a sudden that "bargain puppy" was more expensive than the top-quality pup you almost purchased. Cheap is expensive when it comes to Micro Frenchie puppies.
        </p>
        <h3>Mini French Bulldogs</h3>
        <p>
           The breeders and puppy mills nowadays are producing dogs which do not look anything near to the Frenchie standard. Coming out in tall, long and with a tail, once grown up fully these dogs end up nothing like a stereotypical French bulldog. Many Frenchie breeders nowadays are labeling their puppies as Mini French bulldog puppies for sale also at times called Micro Frenchies for sale.
        </p>
        <h3>Micro Frenchie</h3>
        <p>
        For this reason, the breeders of French Bulldog started referring to their puppies as "Mini French Bulldog for sale" or "Tea Cup Frenchie puppies," whereas in fact they just are of the right size and proportion.
        </p>
        <p>
        They also sometimes refer to the dog as a "micro Frenchie" when it should be that small to begin with, anyway. Just be very leery out there because all the little backyard breeders or Nigerian scammers make it ridiculously hard to dig through the mire for a quality dog.
