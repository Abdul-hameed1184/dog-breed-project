        <h2>FRENCHIES FOR SALE</h2>
        <p>
          Frenchies for sale can be found in all shapes, sizes and colors. When
          choosing a french bulldog puppy for sale, you will need to do your
          homework, and not rush. There are so many back yard breeders that have
          taken to selling on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cheap is expensive when it comes to the French Bulldog. If you see
          breeders selling pups under 5k don’t walk away, run. To understand
          where the price comes from, you must first understand the costs
          associated with breeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we have the cost of the father/stud. Our studs cost us over
          $50,000 on average albeit they are about to sire countless litters
          until around 5 years of age. Female dogs in our program are just as
          expensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have spared no expense when putting together our bloodlines.
          Females that produce puppies here cost our program an average of
          $25-30,000 each. Each female is bred 2 to 3 times maximum and produces
          and average of 4 puppies per litter.
        </p>
        <h4>Veterinary Expenses associated with each litter</h4>
        <p>
          Veterinary expense runs around $10,000 per litter including the
          C-section, Artificial insemination, and Progesterone testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each puppy also costs around $200.00 in total vet bills before leaving
          here with it’s first 2 rounds of shots. So costs on our puppies will
          run us around $6000 and up if we were to work for free.
        </p>
        <p>
          These costs are where we get our total pup price from. Being
          transparent with our costs associated with breeding is important to us
          as people sometimes do not understand the undertaking involved with
          breeding this special breed of dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          We highly recommend that you do not consider buying a dog from a
          “facebook or craigslist” post. Buying the right frenchie puppy is key
          to enjoying what the breed standard is supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you buy a puppy from us, you not only receive a health guarantee,
          you also receive years of support and decades of genetic work all in
          one

        <h4>French Bulldog puppy</h4>
        <p>
          One of the more interesting variations of a Merle French Bulldog
          puppies is the blue Merle Frenchie. A Blue Merle French bulldog will
          have the same broken pattern as any other variant of Merle. The shaded
          color will in this case be blue. So it would be blue over white, as
          opposed to black, lilac, tan, brown, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Blue Merle French Bulldog are rare and quite expensive. Blue Merle
          Frenchie prices are in median range. On Average, a quality blue merle
          frenchie puppy will run you 8-12,000.00 as a pet, and even more if you
          are looking for full AKC registration for breeding. Lastly, with
          french bulldog genetics, there are a wide number of french bulldog
          colors available to consider!
        </p>
        <h4>French Bulldog puppies</h4>
        <p>
          Looking for the perfect brindle french bulldog puppies? Brindle French
          Bulldog puppies are more common than most other French Bulldog colors.
          Not considered one of the more rare French bulldog colors, a brindle
          Frenchie puppy is thought by some French Bulldog breeders to also come
          with better structure than other colors.
        </p>
        <h4> French Bulldog Puppy</h4>
        <p>
          A Brindle Frenchie is one of the staple colors of the breed itself.
          Interestingly, most high level breeders try to avoid brindle as it
          overrides and breaks up the main colors of the dog. Why? Because it is
          a dominant trait. We see the same thing with the pied coloration. A
          French Bulldog Breeder actually will try not to breed a dog carries
          both pied and / or brindle as it will break the base color and
          override it as dominant. Brindle Frenchie pups along with pied and
          fawn are most common and probably the most affordable. Typically, we
          do not produce any pied, brindle or fawn Frenchie puppies.
        </p>

          bulldog. “Fluffy Frenchies for sale” or Fluffy Frenchie puppies for
          sale are becoming common searches from soon to be puppy owners. The
          way the fluffy French Bulldog gene works is that both parents must
          carry a copy of the L4 gene. If each parent carries at least one copy,
          than the puppies will either be visually fluffy or carry at least one
          copy of the gene for long fur.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h4>Lilac French Bulldog puppies for sale</h4>
        <p>
          Until about a decade ago, Lilac Frenchie for sale were a figment of
          imagination. After years of careful breeding, Lilac French bulldog
          breeder groups were able to create a beautiful pigment that almost
          glows light purple, or lilac, and named it accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes people will confuse lilac with blue but Lilac is normally
          going to be lighter, and react much differently to light itself. When
          first born typically they look very similar (blue and lilac) however,
          once 4-6 weeks old you can see the difference. The way a lilac french
          bulldog puppy looks is significantly lighter than a blue french
          bulldog.
        </p>
        <h4>Lilac Merle French bulldog</h4>
        <p>
          One of the most rare and beautiful of all French Bulldog colors is the
          lilac Merle Frenchie. Lilac Merle French bulldog make up an amazing
          group of color combinations. Less of a contrast when compared to blue,
          lilac is still beautiful and some prefer it. Close in look to the blue
          Merle French Bulldog, the lilac is even more rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Owning a lilac merle Frenchie puppy is just as rewarding as every
          other color, they’re just even cooler looking than most! Frenchie
          puppies for sale of all colors are considered more expensive due to
          the cost of c sections and stud fees, and these guys are no different.
        </p>
