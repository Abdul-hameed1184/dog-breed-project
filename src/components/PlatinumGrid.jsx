        <h1>PLATINUM FRENCH BULLDOG</h1>

        <p>
          The coolest and most exotic color would have to be the Platinum French
          Bulldog. The good thing is that Platinum Frenchies come in a couple of
          base coats covered by cream. That is the reason we refer to it as
          Lilac Platinum or Isabella Platinum French Bulldog or blue platinum.

          have been had cream not over-ridden the color. There is just something
