        <h4>Fluffy French Bulldogs</h4>
        <p>
          The newest and rarest and some say the cutest is the fluffy french
          bulldog for sale. “Fluffy Frenchies for sale” or Fluffy Frenchie
          puppies for sale are becoming common searches from soon to be puppy
          owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          The way the fluffy French Bulldog gene works is that both parents must
          carry a copy of the L4 gene. If each parent carries at least one copy,
          than the puppies will either be visually fluffy or carry at least one
          copy of the gene for long fur.
        </p>
        <h4>Fluffy French Bulldog puppies</h4>
        <p>
          From time to time, we will offer some beautiful fluffy frenchies to
          approved homes. Since they are so rare, our Fluffy parents cost in the
          neighborhood of 30-65k per dog. This means the fluffy puppies cost
          will be significantly higher than even the other rare colors. Keep in
          mind these are going to be amazing pups and absolutely as stunning
          visually as they are rare. While the AKC doesn’t let you choose
          “fluffy” they are still fully registered with papers.
        </p>
        <h4>Fluffy Frenchie Puppies</h4>
        <p>
          Like all other Frenchies, fluffs come in different colors including
          all of the common and rare Frenchie colors. French bulldog genetics
          are fun to work with and we are able to create some of the most
          amazing fluffy frenchie colors you will ever see.
        </p>
        <p>
          While they are all gorgeous, the rarer colors of fluffy frenchies will
          cost more than the more common. For example, a Lilac tan Fluffy will
          cost more than a brindle fluffy. At the same time, a Isabella Fluffy
          will cost more than a Lilac Fluff.
