          The newest and rarest and some say the cutest is the fluffy french
          bulldog. “Fluffy Frenchies for sale” or Fluffy Frenchie puppy for sale
          are becoming common searches from soon to be puppy owners. The way the
          fluffy French Bulldog gene works is that both parents must carry a
          copy of the L4 gene. If each parent carries at least one copy, than
          the puppies will either be visually fluffy or carry at least one copy
          of the gene for long fur.
