        <h1>FRENCH BULLDOG COLOR CHAT</h1>
        <p>
          As regarding how it affects the pricing of French Bulldogs, Frenchie
          Colors' range on colors depends on their rarity. Prices depend on how
          rare a color is. A blue Frenchie puppy would be much more
          budget-friendly than a chocolate one. An Isabella costs more than a
          blue or lilac but less than a Rojo. Add in the merle variation of each
          color, tricolor merles, too, and you have a wide range and rainbow of
          amazing dogs.

        <h1>UNUSUAL FRECHIES COLORS</h1>
        <p>
          Some of the rarest colors of Frenchie, or rare Frenchie colors are
          also available as fluffy. Of all french bulldog puppies for sale
          Fluffy frenchie puppies are the rarest and therefore the most
          expensive. These are available in all colors but as a "long haired"
          version. Beautiful and super hard to find, usually new frenchie owners
          will be on a wait list for a fluffy French puppy. In considering the
          price of a frenchie puppy for sale, the color and coat type normally
          are most responsible for the cost.
        </p>
        <h1>FAWN FRENCH BULLDOG FOR SALE</h1>
        <p>
          Common and therefore a bit cheaper in cost is the Fawn. Most breeders
          do not breed fawn as it is dominant over other colors. The Fawn French
          bulldog for sale, or "Fawn Frenchie" is one of the most common and
          oldest of all colors. This color has been around, almost longer than
          any other color and is a dominant color. The fault here is, often it
          overrides some of the newer, more expensive varieties. Such as you may
          have a blue puppy or you may have a blue fawn puppy, where the fall
          over rides all but the mask area would be blue.
        </p>
        <h1>PLATINUM FRENCH BULLDOG </h1>
        <p>
          Platinum French bulldog puppies for sale are also rare and gorgeous.
          Did you know that the platinum Frenchie is also available in fluffy,
          or long-haired? These furry Frenchies, or Fluffies as most people call
          them are so darn cute! Yes, it's true! Even platinum Fluffy Frenchies
          are sometimes available. A Platinum French bulldog cost will hover in
          the 7000-9900.00 range as a pet and 12-14k as a full registration; if
          fluffy, add 20k. The rare fluffy platinum frenchie will run over 25k
          per pup. Your success depends upon finding the right bloodlines in
          finding the perfect platinum french bulldog puppy
        </p>
        <img src="/images/colors2.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Colors other than the most common - black, fawn, white, or pied - are
          going to be far more exotic, much more than because of this fact, most
          of the higher level breeders do not work with the older, dominant
          colors that override the color chart, such as pied, brindle, or fawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          A brindle dog is a dominant color so it overrides basically every
          other color you breed them to. So you would have a Rojo puppy that if
          it had brindle would loss around 8000.00 of value due to brindle over
          riding the extremely rare Rojo coloration which is a variant of
          chocolate.
        </p>
        <h1>MERLE FRENCH BULLDOG FOR SALE</h1>
        <p>
          The merle French bulldog can come in many colors and coat types
          including blue, lilac, isabella, Rojo and more. The Most popular of
          all are the blue Merle french bulldog. Secondly the lilac merle
          frenchie is popular and priced a little bit higher than the blue. Keep
          in mind that Blue merles will be different in look than the solid blue
          French bulldog.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lilac will be lighter in color, and both will be close in color
          and look. Merle Frenchie puppies are just so adorable and super unique
          since no two ever look the same!
        </p>
        <h1>MERLE FRNCHIES COLOR</h1>
        <p>
          Here at Designer French Bulldogs, nearly every single litter we have
          has at least 1 or 2 Merle French bulldog puppies. Pricing will depend
          on which color you choose and if they are fluffy, a fluffy carrier, or
          no fluffy. Last but not least, the merle french bulldog price will
          depend on that above information. If you want unique, consider the
          merle french bulldogs for sale that are amazing in our available pup
          section!
        </p>
        <h1>LILAC AND BLUE MERLES</h1>
        <p>
          Besides the blue version another beautiful and popular color from the
          Merle family is the Lilac Merle French bulldog. Unlike the solid lilac
          french bulldog puppies, or blue french bulldog puppies, the broken
          pattern is what makes them unique. Even cooler looking are the tan
          pointed merle variants!
        </p>
        <h1>BLUE MERLE FRENCHIES</h1>

        <h1>FLUFFY FRENCHIES COLORS</h1>
        <p>
          Fluffy French bulldog variations also exist in all of the above!
          Remember that fluffy frenchie puppies will cost more than a
          non-fluffy. For instance, Lilac French Bulldog puppies that are also
          fluffy would go for higher, compared to a non-fluffy by about 30%.
          Fluffy French Bulldog puppies are one of the rarest Frenchie colors.
          Isabella Fluffy will fall within the higher end of the French bulldog
          price chart, whereas the Blue Fluffy Frenchie will be closer to the
          low-end Frenchie price chart.
        </p>
        <h1>BLACK AND TAN FRENCHIES PUPPIES</h1>
        <p>
          Long long ago, one of the most popular and sought-after and considered
          rare French bulldog colors was black and tan! However, now probably
          the most common is the black and tan French bulldog. Black and tan
          frenchie pups are stunning in their own right and at one time were
          very sought after. These are some stunning pups non the less however
          most breeders do not work with black as it is considered a dominant
          color that may over ride the newer, more rare colors.
        </p>
        <h1>COMMON FRENCH BULLDOG COLORS</h1>
        <p>
          Now, among the most popular, they are middle to low-priced unless they
          hold other colors and are visual or a carrier of the fluffy gene. All
          of this is only important to the buyer if they're a breeder of the
          Frenchie, of course! Finding black and tan french bulldog puppies is
          not difficult but finding quality always is. There are a dime a dozen
          puppy mill websites selling low quality pups year round.
        </p>
        <h2>Isabella Frenchies for sale</h2>
        <p>
          If you want rare, then the Isabella French Bulldog is the one for you.
          There are two shades, including the normal Isabella french bulldog
          puppies and the new shade isabella Frenchie. Our Bella is new shade
          with tan points and is absolutely stunning. She comes from dezigner
          bullz lines from the UK. This color is one of the most popular of all,
          and on the higher half of the pricing scale.
        </p>
        <h2>Fluffy French Bulldog colors</h2>
        <p>
          The newest and rarest and some say the cutest is the fluffy french
          bulldog. "Fluffy Frenchies for sale" or Fluffy Frenchie puppies for
          sale are becoming common searches from soon to be puppy owners. The
          way the fluffy French Bulldog gene works is that both parents must
          carry a copy of the L4 gene. Provided that each parent carries at
          least one copy, puppies will be either visually Fluffy or carry at
          least one copy of the long hair gene.
        </p>
        <h3>Fluffy French Bulldog puppies for sale</h3>
        <p>
          Occasionally we will have a few fluffy french bulldog puppies
          available for sale to qualified applicants. As they are so rare, our
          Fluffy parents cost in the neighborhood of 30-65k per dog. This means
          the cost of the fluffy puppies is going to be significantly more than
          even the other more rare colors. To be sure, these will be some
          incredible pups, and absolutely as stunning to behold as they are
          rare.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fluffy Frenchie puppies for sale are just like all other Frenchies and
          come in different colors, including all of the common and rare French
          Bulldog colors. Top AKC French bulldog genetics are fun to work with,
          and we are able to create some of the most amazing fluffy frenchie
          colors you will ever see. While they are all gorgeous, the rarer
          colors of fluffy frenchies will cost more than the more common. For
          example, a Lilac tan Fluffy will cost more than a brindle fluffy. At
          the same time, a Isabella Fluffy will cost more than a Lilac Fluff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with top Frenchie bloodlines we are proud to offer the
          following types of Frenchie puppies for sale include:

        <h5>French Bulldog Colors</h5>
        <p>
          Our French bulldog babies are available throughout the year and ready
          to go home at 8 weeks or older. From time to time and with few
          exceptions, we will hold a dog back and offer them slightly older to
          decide whether they should be part of our program or whether we
          already have a dog with the same genetics, etc. Understanding the
          different colors and their impact on availability, rarity, and pricing
          is pretty important for one to settle on which type of Frenchy they
          want.
