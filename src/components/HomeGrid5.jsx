        <h1>FRENCH BULLDOG PRICE</h1>
        <p>
        There are a few factors that go into the price of a French Bulldog: the cost of the parents, usually in our case 15-55k per dog; secondly, the cost of the c-section; reproductive veterinary care including progesterone tests before breeding and before birth of the puppies.

        Third would probably be the cost of the equipment, incubators, oxygen concentrators, whelping boxes. Last but not least is our supplements, goats milk and vitamin regiment for both mom, dad and pups. Creating high level Frenchies for sale takes finance, time, experience and passion. Therefore, consider Frenchie Prices a scale from common to rare French bulldog puppies for sale.

        <h2>How Much are French Bulldog puppies?</h2>
        <p>
        If you're looking for Frenchie prices, well look no more. Pricing starts at 6k and all depends on the color and coat type. Typically the females are a bit higher than males, but that is just a general rule of thumb. Usually, the most common the color, the best the price. Such as, black and tan is probably the cheapest. Next would be Blue, then blue and Tan, then blue merle.
        </p>
        <h2>Rare French Bulldog colors</h2>
        <p>
        f you are looking for the most unique pup out there, some of the rarest colors of French Bulldogs might be a great consideration. Commonly referred to as "rare Frenchie colors," they include Rojo, Isabella, Isabella tan, and new shade Isabella, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
        Of course, all those are also available as Merle. So you can also have an Isabella Merle Puppy for example. Keep in mind most every new color is not recognized by the AKC so while they are of course still registered with papers, when choosing their color you are limited.
        </p>
        <p>
        Rare to common, we usually consider it to be: New Shade Isabella Frenchie, Isabella French Bulldog, Lilac Frenchie puppies, Blue, etc. Finding the perfect French Bulldog puppy for sale could be based on your color choice, but more often than not, it's based on your budget. This is because usually, the rarer the Frenchie color, the more expensive the price of that particular French Bulldog Puppy.
