        <h1>CHOCOLATE FRENCH BULLDOG PUPPIES</h1>
        <p>
          The Chocolate French Bulldog puppies for sale are just beautiful
          within the Frenchie Breed and are indeed a classic color. Chocolate is
          also part of the new Isabella program and now responsible for some
          beautiful new colors. These new colors are also known as new shade, or
          new shades and are based on carrying either 1 or 2 copies of the
          Chocolate gene allele.

          The price point of a Chocolate Frenchie is in the higher end of the
          spectrum because they are highly sought after and very rare. Do not
          get cocoa confused with Chocolate because it's different and almost
          black. Chocolate French bulldog puppies aren't just super rare; they
          can also come in a number of colors or shades of chocolate. Below are
          a few of the colors along with photos. When we have chocolate pups
          available, they usually sell the same day we list them on our website.
          More often than not, these puppies are reserved the moment they are
          born, or sometimes in advance of the entire breeding!
